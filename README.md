### Overview

Turn your ideas into investments with MintoCrypto. Ideas are essential to the tech industry. But ideas are just as fragile as they are valuable. We want to disrupt the market with MintoCrypto aims to make it easy for anyone to mint their idea, a trademark, a phrase, or even a new feature for an existing product on the block chain.

- Using the technology behind NFTs to mint your intellectual property permanently on the blockchain
  - mint an app, business, or tech idea 
  - a trademark or phrase 
  - maybe even feature for an existing product or app
  - schematics

The idea is with decentralized ledgers it would be impossible to produce who was first to mint their genius.

- The tokens can be launched on 
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project

### Project Details

Our team has had success developing and designing to our professional standard. We are now seeing funding through grants to incentivise and fund the foundation and tech stacks needed to build our industry disrupting vision. The grant funds will go towards exploring  

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
- We are not an NFT art company evenn though we have a world class 3D artist on the team
- We do not see value in bored apes but the technology behind those apes is the next evolutionary  phase of the internet.
